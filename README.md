# First MERN project 'frontend'
I created as a project to test my dev skills. And also to get better.

## On your machine

If you want to try this fullstack project for yourself, go to [the repo for the backend](https://github.com/Beefy-py/mern-project-backend.git) and clone it into a folder. Then clone this repo in the same folder as where you cloned the backend.

In the server directory, you can run: `npm i` then `npm start`
In the client directory, you can run: `npm i` then `npm start`
